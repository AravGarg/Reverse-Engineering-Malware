Static Malware Analysis

1. Open ```Bomb.ex_``` with ```PEiD```:
    ```Plugins->Krypto-Analyzer``` gives the Kryto Algorithms used.
2. Open  ```Bomb.ex_``` with ```CFF Explorer```:
    ```Identifier``` gives the compliler/packer.
    note: If number of import libraries or functions are small, high chance of it being packed.
    ```Section headers``` give the section names.
3. Open ```Bomb.ex_``` with ```BinText```:
    Gives the strings.
    
    
## Data encoding algorithms

1. Open ```4a29d41dfda9cfcbcde4d42b4bbb00aa.ex_``` with ```IDA```:
   Option-T with xor gives all occurances of xor in the binary.
   xor with a constant value and a loop is 1 indicator of xor encoding being used.
2. Open ```mspnsnsv.dl_``` with ```IDA```:
   Option-T with xor gives all occurances of xor.
   xor of different registers is likely to be an xor encoding algorithm variant.
