Static Malware Analysis

1. Open ```Bomb.ex_``` with ```PEiD```:
    ```Plugins->Krypto-Analyzer``` gives the Kryto Algorithms used.
2. Open  ```Bomb.ex_``` with ```CFF Explorer```:
    ```Identifier``` gives the compliler/packer.
    note: If number of import libraries or functions are small, high chance of it being packed.
    ```Section headers``` give the section names.
3. Open ```Bomb.ex_``` with ```BinText```:
    Gives the strings.
    
    
## Data encoding algorithms

1. Open ```4a29d41dfda9cfcbcde4d42b4bbb00aa.ex_``` with ```IDA```:
   Option-T with xor gives all occurances of xor in the binary.
   xor with a constant value and a loop is an indicator of xor encoding being used.
   Open ```4a29d41dfda9cfcbcde4d42b4bbb00aa.ex_``` with ```PEiD```:
    Krypto-Analyzer gives all crypto algorithms in the binary. Export to IDC file and open          ```4a29d41dfda9cfcbcde4d42b4bbb00aa.ex_``` with ```IDA``` and load the IDC file.
    Open ```4a29d41dfda9cfcbcde4d42b4bbb00aa.ex_``` with ```ida-ent.exe```:
    Chunk size 0x40 and max entropy 5.97 gives occurances of crypto algos with given entropy.

2. Open ```mspnsnsv.dl_``` with ```IDA```:
   Option-T with xor gives all occurances of xor.
   xor of different registers is likely to be an xor encoding algorithm variant.

3. Open ```WEBC2-CLOVER_sample_065E63AFDFA539727F63AF7530B22D2F``` with ```IDA```:
   Option-B with "ABCDEFGH....P" gives a binary search for this string.
   Open ```WEBC2-CLOVER_sample_065E63AFDFA539727F63AF7530B22D2F``` with ```PEiD```:
   PEiD identifies the base-64 encoding algo. ZLib compression is also detected.

4. Open ```WEBC2-CSON_sample_A38A367D6696BA90B2E778A5A4BF98FD``` with ```IDA```:
   Option-B with "ABCDEFGH....P" gives a binary search for this string.
   Open ```WEBC2-CSON_sample_A38A367D6696BA90B2E778A5A4BF98FD``` with ```ida-ent.exe```:
   Chunk size 0x40 and max entropy 5.97 gives all occurances of the custom alphabet.

5. Open ```Old2008-2010__A6C1595BD7B1A85C42FBD674460DC35D_iprinp.dl_``` with ```IDA```:
   Option-B with "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP" gives a binary search of this string.
   Open ```Old2008-2010__A6C1595BD7B1A85C42FBD674460DC35D_iprinp.dl_``` with ```ida-ent.exe```:
   Chunk size 0x40 and max entropy 5.97 gives occurances of the custom alphabet as well as other crypto algos.
   
6. Open ```WEBC2-UGX_sample_8462A62F13F92C34E4B89A7D13A185AD``` with ```IDA```:
   String obfuscation is detected in the function sub_406044().
